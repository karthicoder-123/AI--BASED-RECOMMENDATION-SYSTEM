# AI-Based Recommendation System â€“ Project Overview

# An AI-Based Recommendation System is a software solution that suggests items, products, or content to users based on their behavior, preferences, and patterns. These systems are commonly seen in platforms like Netflix (movie recommendations), Amazon (product recommendations), and Spotify (music suggestions). The core purpose is to enhance user experience by offering personalized content, thereby increasing engagement and satisfaction.

# This project involves the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to analyze historical data, understand user preferences, and predict future interests. Recommendation systems are a prime example of practical AI applications that combine data science, programming, and predictive modeling.
